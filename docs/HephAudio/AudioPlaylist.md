### Description
Class for creating playlists. Uses [AudioStream](/docs/HephAudio/AudioStream.md) internally to play the files.
<br><br>


### Macros

```c++
#define HEPHAUDIO_PLAYLIST_EVENT_USER_ARG_KEY
```
The key to find the ``AudioPlaylist`` instance when handling events.
<br><br>


### Enums
```c++
enum TransitionEffect : uint8_t
{
    None,
    Delay,
    Fade,
    FadeIn,
    FadeOut
};
```
Indicates which effect will be applied while switching from one file to another.
